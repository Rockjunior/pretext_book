  <title>Algebraic Expressions</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    We often use math to solve problems in our daily lives. For example:
  </p>
  <p>
    - How much will it cost to buy a certain number of books?
  </p>
  <p>
  - Measuring the total water needed to fill multiple containers.
  </p>
   <p>
   To describe and solve these problems, we can use algebraic expressions. These expressions combine numbers, letters, and operations to represent real-life situations.

          In algebra, we use letters to form algebraic expressions.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Identify and form four groups of objects according to their similarities.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                          To each group add or subtract a number of items.
                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Form and write expressions to represent the new number of items in each group.
                        </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                            Discuss and share with other groups.
                        </p>
                      </li>

          <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  In a classroom of <m>30</m> learners there are <m>n</m> boys. Form an expression for the number of girls.
                </p>
              </statement>

              <solution>
                  <p>
                      If the number of boys is <m>n</m>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To get the number of girls we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of learners
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The number of girls is; <m>30 - n</m>
                  </p>
              </solution>
          </example>

          <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  There are <m>x</m> mangoes and <m>y</m> oranges a farm.  Form an expression for the total number of mango and orange trees in the farm.
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  The total number of mango and orange trees are <m>x + y.</m>
                </p>
              </solution>
