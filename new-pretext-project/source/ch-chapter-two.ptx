  <introduction>
  
    <p> Algebra is a part of mathematics in which letters and other general symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.</p>
      <p>
        Algebra is a branch of math where we use letters (like <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>... ) to stand for numbers that we don't know yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        These letters are called variables.

        <term>Why Learn Algebra?</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal in algebra is to find out what number the letter (variable) represents by solving a problem or equation.
