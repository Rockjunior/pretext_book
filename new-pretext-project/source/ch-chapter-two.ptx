    <p> <em>Introduction </em></p>
      <p>
        Algebra is a branch of math where we use letters (like <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>... ) to stand for numbers that we don't know yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        These letters are called variables.

      </p>
      <p>
        The goal in algebra is to find out what number the letter (variable) represents by solving a problem or equation.
